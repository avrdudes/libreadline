# GNU readline for Windows

This library is a fork of the [GNU readline library](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/readline/).
The design objective of **libreadline for Windows** is to provide a better
out-of-the-box experience for AVRDUDE Windows users by supporting the
GNU readline library on Windows.

The latest version of libreadline for Windows can be found here:\
